*Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven*

*by W. B. Yeats, 1865-1939*

> Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
>
> Enwrought with golden and silver light,
>
> The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
>
> Of night and light and the half light,
>
> I would spread the cloths under your feet:
>
> But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
>
> I have spread my dreams under your feet;
>
> Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
