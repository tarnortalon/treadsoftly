*Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven*

*by W. B. Yeats, 1865-1939*

> Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
>
> Enwrought with golden and silver light,
>
> The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
>
> Of night and light and the half light,
>
> I would spread the cloths under your feet:
>
> But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
>
> I have spread my dreams under your feet;
>
> Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

I first heard of this poem in Sir Ken Robinson's famous TED talk (linked below).

It strikes me as delicately accurate and moving. Our kids are full human beings
with their own hopes and dreams. We, as parents, actually have an enormous
responsibility to safeguard the environment for those hopes and dreams to bud
and thrive. We usually don't realize how important a role we could be playing
for our kids and how dependent they are on us. We ought to choose our steps
carefully as we truly tread on their dreams.
